RAG Chatbot with Document Upload
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built with Streamlit, allowing users to upload documents (CSV, TXT, PDF, DOCX, JSON) and ask questions based on their content. The app uses LangChain, FAISS, and HuggingFace embeddings for document retrieval and question answering, featuring a vibrant UI with a bubble-style input, colorful messages, and an expandable chat history.
Features

Document Upload: Supports CSV, TXT, PDF, DOCX, and JSON files for content extraction and querying.
RAG Pipeline: Uses FAISS for vector storage and HuggingFace embeddings (sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for similarity-based retrieval.
Interactive UI: Includes a sidebar for uploads and debug mode, a main chat area with bubble-style input, and a chat history column with expandable entries.
Debug Mode: Displays retrieved documents and source content for transparency during development.
Chat History: Persists user questions and bot responses, with a clear history option.
Styling: Vibrant gradient background (indigo to teal), purple user messages, yellow bot messages, and green buttons for a modern look.

I Dont have OPENAI API as it is a paid version hence i have used huggingface llm in this chatbot,openai would have reduced the code structure even more better way

Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
Git
Streamlit Community Cloud account (for deployment)


pip install -r requirements.txt

Dependencies (listed in requirements.txt):


Run the App Locally:
streamlit run streamlit_app.py

The app will open in your default browser at http://localhost:8501.


Usage

Upload a Document:

Use the sidebar to upload a document (CSV, TXT, PDF, DOCX, or JSON).
Supported formats are processed using LangChain loaders (document_loader.py).
A success or error message will appear in the sidebar.


Enable Debug Mode (optional):

Check the "Debug Mode" box in the sidebar to view document content and retrieved chunks.

View Chat History:

The right column displays chat history with expandable entries (click to view full question and answer).
Use the "Clear History" button to reset the conversation.

Test the Deployed App:

Upload a document, ask questions, and verify the UI and functionality.
Note: If using a large LLM (e.g., google/flan-t5-small), ensure it fits within Streamlit Cloud’s resource limits (1GB RAM).

Limitations
create a webpage that recieves document and asnswers the questions of the user chatbot with rag


I'll create a simple webpage that allows users to upload a document and interact with a chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Since this involves a web application, I'll use HTML, JavaScript, and a basic RAG implementation with a mock backend for demonstration. The frontend will handle document upload and chat interaction, while the backend logic will be simulated with JavaScript for simplicity. Note that a full RAG system typically requires a server with a vector database and embeddings, but here I'll mock the RAG functionality for client-side demonstration.

index.html
html

How It Works
Document Upload: Users can upload a .txt file using the file input. The file is read client-side using the FileReader API, and its content is stored in documentContent.
Chat Interface: Users can type questions in the input field and send them by clicking the "Send" button or pressing Enter.
Mock RAG Implementation:
The mockRAGProcess function simulates RAG by splitting the document into chunks (lines) and filtering for chunks containing the question keywords.
It returns a response based on the retrieved chunks or a fallback message if no relevant information is found.
Styling: Uses Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design. Messages are styled differently for user and bot, with a scrollable chat container.
Limitations: This is a client-side mock. A real RAG system would involve a server with a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate) and embeddings (e.g., from a model like BERT). The mock assumes text files and performs simple keyword matching.
How to Use
Save the code as index.html.
Open it in a browser.
Upload a .txt file with some content.
Ask questions related to the document, and the chatbot will respond based on the content.
For a production RAG system, you’d need a backend with a vector database and an API (e.g., xAI’s API at https://x.ai/api). Let me know if you want to extend this with a specific backend setup or additional features!







1.5s
this is very simple, create realistic chatbot ui


I'll create a more realistic and polished chatbot UI for a RAG-based application, enhancing the previous version with a modern design, improved user experience, and additional features like message history persistence, typing indicators, and a more sophisticated layout. The RAG functionality will remain a mock client-side implementation for simplicity, but the UI will be professional, responsive, and user-friendly, using Tailwind CSS and modern JavaScript. I'll include features like a collapsible sidebar for document management, a sleek chat interface, and subtle animations.

index.html
html

Enhancements Over Previous Version
Modern UI:
Sidebar: Collapsible sidebar for document management, with a toggle button and close option.
Chat Interface: Sleek, rounded messages with distinct user (blue) and bot (gray) styles, auto-scrolling, and a fixed-height chat container.
Typing Indicator: Animated dots appear while the bot "processes" the response, mimicking real chatbot behavior.
Header: Includes a clear chat button and app title.
Responsive Design: Uses Tailwind CSS for a clean, mobile-friendly layout.
Features:
Message Persistence: Chat history is saved in localStorage and loaded on page refresh.
Document Management: Supports multiple document uploads (though only the last is used for RAG in this mock).
File Support: Accepts .txt and .pdf (though PDF parsing requires a server in production).
Clear Chat: Option to reset the conversation.
Animations: Smooth sidebar transitions and typing indicator animations.
Icons: Uses Font Awesome for intuitive icons (e.g., send button, sidebar toggle).
RAG Mock: Remains client-side with keyword-based retrieval, but simulates a processing delay for realism.
How to Use
Save the code as index.html.
Open in a browser.
Click the menu icon to open the sidebar, upload a .txt file (PDF parsing is not implemented client-side).
Type questions in the input field and press Enter or the send button.
Use the clear chat button to reset the conversation.
Notes
RAG Limitation: The RAG is mocked with simple keyword matching. A real implementation would use a vector database (e.g., Pinecone) and embeddings (e.g., via xAI’s API at https://x.ai/api).
PDF Support: Listed for realism, but client-side PDF parsing requires libraries like pdf.js, which I omitted for simplicity. A server-side solution is needed for production.
Scalability: For a production app, integrate a backend with a proper RAG pipeline (document embedding, retrieval, and LLM generation).
Let me know if you want to add specific features (e.g., PDF parsing, backend integration, or advanced styling)!

can you add colours and message input as bubbles


I'll update the previous RAG chatbot webpage to incorporate a more vibrant color scheme and transform the message input area into a bubble-like design for a more engaging and modern look. The color palette will be lively yet professional, and the input field will have a rounded, bubble-like appearance with subtle animations. The core functionality (document upload and mock RAG) remains unchanged, but I'll enhance the visual appeal and ensure the message input feels like a chat bubble. Since this is an update to the previous artifact, I'll use the same artifact_id and include all content with the requested changes.

Changes Made
Color Scheme:
Background: Gradient from indigo to teal (from-indigo-100 to-teal-100) for a vibrant, modern look.
Messages:
User messages: Vibrant purple (#7c3aed) with white text for contrast.
Bot messages: Soft yellow (#fef3c7) with dark text for readability.
Sidebar: Light gray (#f8fafc) with indigo accents (text-indigo-700, bg-indigo-500 for buttons).
Input Area: Gradient background (from-indigo-50 to-teal-50) to blend with the main theme.
Buttons: Send button uses emerald green (#10b981) for a lively pop, with a darker hover state (#059669).
Text and Icons: Indigo and rose hues for headers, buttons, and icons to maintain consistency.
Bubble Input Design:
The input area is wrapped in a bubble-input class with a rounded (border-radius: 2rem), elevated look (box-shadow).
Subtle animation on focus: Scales slightly (transform: scale(1.02)) and enhances shadow for a dynamic effect.
The input field itself is transparent with no border, blending into the bubble container.
The send button is a circular icon button within the bubble, using a green background for contrast.
Placeholder text is styled to match the chat's aesthetic.
Other UI Enhancements:
Added subtle shadows to messages for a 3D bubble effect.
Improved sidebar text colors to match the theme (text-indigo-600 for document names).
Ensured all elements (header, buttons, typing indicator) use the new color palette for cohesion.
How to Use
Save the code as index.html.
Open it in a browser.
Use the sidebar (toggle via menu icon) to upload .txt files (PDF parsing requires server-side logic).
Type questions in the bubble-like input field and press Enter or the send button.
Clear the chat using the "Clear Chat" button in the header.
Notes
RAG Functionality: Unchanged from the previous version; uses mock keyword-based retrieval. For a real RAG system, integrate a backend with a vector database and embeddings (e.g., via xAI’s API at https://x.ai/api).
PDF Support: Included in the UI but not functional client-side. Add pdf.js or a server-side parser for production.
Accessibility: The color scheme is vibrant but maintains sufficient contrast for readability. Test with accessibility tools for production use.
Let me know if you want further refinements, like specific colors, additional animations, or backend integration!

i need the exact layout in this program, dont change the logic, make the ui changes alone


To match the layout of the provided Streamlit RAG chatbot while preserving the exact logic, I'll adapt the previous HTML-based UI to replicate Streamlit's layout and incorporate the vibrant color scheme and bubble-like message input from the last version. The Streamlit app features a title, a sidebar for document upload and debug mode, a main chat area with a text input, and a chat history column. I'll use Tailwind CSS and JavaScript to mimic this structure, ensuring the UI closely resembles Streamlit’s aesthetic (clean, modern, with a sidebar and column layout) while keeping the mock RAG logic from the previous HTML version. Since this is an update to the existing artifact, I'll use the same artifact_id.

UI Changes to Match Streamlit Layout
Layout Structure:
Sidebar: Mimics Streamlit’s sidebar with a fixed width (w-80), containing the app title, document upload section, and a debug mode checkbox. Always visible to match Streamlit’s default behavior.
Main Content: Uses a flexbox layout with two columns (3:1 ratio) to replicate st.columns([3, 1]):
Chat Column: Contains the chat title, chat container, bubble input, and debug output (hidden unless debug mode is enabled).
History Column: Displays chat history with expandable items, mimicking Streamlit’s st.expander.
Responsive Design: Columns stack vertically on smaller screens (using md:flex-row) to match Streamlit’s responsiveness.
Color Scheme:
Retained the vibrant palette from the previous version:
Background: Gradient from indigo to teal (from-indigo-100 to-teal-100).
User messages: Purple (#7c3aed).
Bot messages: Soft yellow (#fef3c7).
Sidebar and buttons: Indigo accents (text-indigo-700, bg-indigo-500).
Send button: Emerald green (#10b981).
Clear history button: Rose (#rose-500).
Adjusted text and border colors to maintain contrast and Streamlit’s clean aesthetic.
Bubble Input:
Kept the bubble-like input design (border-radius: 2rem, shadow, scale animation on focus) from the previous version, placed at the bottom of the chat column to match Streamlit’s st.text_input placement.
Input placeholder and send button icon align with the Streamlit app’s prompt.
Chat History:
Implemented expandable history items using JavaScript to toggle visibility, mimicking Streamlit’s st.expander. Each item shows a truncated question (if >30 characters) and expands to show the full question and answer.
Added a “Clear History” button at the bottom of the history column, styled to match Streamlit’s button (bg-rose-500).
Debug Mode:
Added a debug mode checkbox in the sidebar, matching Streamlit’s st.sidebar.checkbox.
When enabled, shows document content on upload and retrieved documents on query, displayed below the chat input (hidden by default).
File Upload:
Updated the file input to accept .csv, .txt, .pdf, .docx, and .json, matching Streamlit’s st.file_uploader types.
Displays success or error messages as bot messages, mimicking Streamlit’s st.success and st.error.
Logic Preservation
The mock RAG logic (mockRAGProcess) is unchanged from the previous version, using keyword-based retrieval for simplicity.
Document upload uses FileReader for .txt files (PDF/DOCX/JSON parsing would require server-side logic, not implemented here to match the Streamlit code’s dependency on load_documents).
Message persistence in localStorage mirrors Streamlit’s st.session_state.chat_history.
Debug mode toggles visibility of retrieved documents and document content, aligning with the Streamlit app’s debug behavior.
How to Use
Save the code as index.html.
Open in a browser.
Use the sidebar to upload a .txt file (other formats require server-side parsing).
Enable debug mode to see document content and retrieved chunks.
Ask questions in the bubble input field (Enter or send button).
View chat history in the right column; click items to expand.
Clear history using the button in the history column.
Notes
Limitations: The mock RAG is client-side and only processes .txt files. For production, integrate a backend with FAISS and HuggingFace embeddings, as in the Streamlit code (e.g., via xAI’s API at https://x.ai/api).
Streamlit Fidelity: The layout closely mimics Streamlit’s sidebar, column split, and expander behavior, with a similar clean and modern aesthetic.
Accessibility: Colors maintain sufficient contrast, but test with tools like WAVE for production.
Let me know if you need further tweaks to the UI or integration with a real backend!

cant we implement this in streamlit?


Yes, we can implement the RAG chatbot in Streamlit, using the logic from the provided Python code and adapting the UI to match the vibrant, bubble-like design from the previous HTML version. The Streamlit app will include a sidebar for document upload and debug mode, a main chat area with a bubble-styled input, and a chat history column with expandable items, all styled with a similar color scheme (indigo-teal gradient, purple user messages, yellow bot messages, etc.). Since Streamlit doesn’t natively support Tailwind CSS or Font Awesome, I’ll use Streamlit’s custom CSS via st.markdown with similar styles and leverage Streamlit components to replicate the layout and behavior.

Below is the Streamlit implementation, preserving the exact logic from your provided code (including create_vectorstore, get_qa_chain, extract_content_from_context, and the main structure) while applying the UI enhancements.

Prerequisites
Install required packages:
bash

pip install streamlit langchain faiss-cpu sentence-transformers pypdf docx2txt
Ensure you have a document_loader.py with a load_documents function and a rag_pipeline.py with a get_local_llm function, as referenced in your original code. If these are unavailable, you’ll need to provide them or use placeholder implementations (I’ll include placeholders below for completeness).

UI Changes to Match Previous HTML Version
Color Scheme:
Background: Gradient from indigo to teal (#c7d2fe to #a5f3fc) to match the HTML’s from-indigo-100 to-teal-100.
Sidebar: Light gray (#f8fafc) for consistency.
Messages:
User: Purple (#7c3aed) with white text.
Bot: Soft yellow (#fef3c7) with dark text (#1e293b).
Buttons:
Send button (implicit via Enter key): Emerald green (#10b981, hover #059669).
Clear history: Rose (#f43f5e, hover #e11d48).
Text and Headers: Indigo (#4f46e5) for titles and labels.
Debug Output: Gray (#475569) for subtle visibility.
Bubble Input:
Styled st.text_input with CSS to have a rounded (border-radius: 1.5rem), elevated look (box-shadow), and scale animation on focus (transform: scale(1.02)).
Removed Streamlit’s default border and used a white background (#ffffff) to mimic the HTML bubble input.
Since Streamlit doesn’t support a send button next to the input, the input submits on Enter, maintaining the bubble aesthetic.
Layout:
Sidebar: Replicates st.sidebar with document upload (st.file_uploader) and debug mode checkbox, styled with indigo accents.
Columns: Uses st.columns([3, 1]) to match the 3:1 chat-to-history ratio, with chat messages in the left column and history in the right.
Chat Area: Messages are displayed as HTML divs with message, user-message, and bot-message classes, styled as rounded bubbles with shadows.
History: Uses st.expander for collapsible history items, styled with borders and hover effects to match the HTML’s expandable history.
Debug Output: Displayed below the chat input when debug mode is enabled, styled with smaller font and gray color.
Additional Styling:
Added shadows to messages and expanders for a 3D effect.
Ensured expanders have a hover effect (background: #f1f5f9) to match the HTML’s history item hover.
Used Streamlit’s st.markdown with unsafe_allow_html=True for custom message rendering.
Logic Preservation
The entire logic from the provided Streamlit code is unchanged, including:
create_vectorstore, get_qa_chain, extract_content_from_context, and the main function structure.
Document upload handling with tempfile and load_documents.
RAG pipeline with FAISS, HuggingFace embeddings, and the QA prompt.
Debug mode behavior and chat history management via st.session_state.
Added placeholder load_documents and get_local_llm functions to ensure the code runs if the original modules are unavailable. Replace these with your actual implementations.
How to Use
Save the code as app.py.
Install dependencies: pip install streamlit langchain faiss-cpu sentence-transformers pypdf docx2txt.
Provide or update document_loader.py and rag_pipeline.py with actual load_documents and get_local_llm functions.
Run the app: streamlit run app.py.
Use the sidebar to upload a document (.txt works with the placeholder; others depend on load_documents).
Enable debug mode to see document content and retrieved chunks.
Ask questions in the bubble input field (submits on Enter).
View and expand chat history in the right column; clear history with the button.
Notes
Dependencies: The placeholder load_documents only handles .txt files. For .pdf, .docx, etc., ensure load_documents uses libraries like pypdf or docx2txt.
LLM: The placeholder get_local_llm uses a fake LLM. Replace with a real model (e.g., from HuggingFace) for production.
Streamlit Limitations: Streamlit doesn’t support inline buttons in text inputs, so the bubble input submits on Enter. The HTML version’s send button icon is approximated by the input’s styling.
Performance: The real RAG pipeline (FAISS, embeddings) is computationally intensive. Test on a machine with sufficient resources or use a cloud-based LLM via xAI’s API (https://x.ai/api).
Let me know if you need help with document_loader.py, rag_pipeline.py, or further UI tweaks!

To meet the requirements of your assignment, I'll guide you through adding the provided code and deliverables to a GitHub repository, creating a sample questions and responses file, and optionally deploying the Streamlit app for bonus points. The code you provided (streamlit_app.py, document_loader.py, rag_pipeline.py) is already well-documented and adheres to Python standards, so I'll focus on the deliverables: organizing the code, creating a sample response file, setting up the GitHub repository, and providing steps for Streamlit deployment. Below, I'll address each requirement and provide a sample response file within an artifact tag.

Step-by-Step Guide to Meet Assignment Requirements
1. Python Code
The provided files (streamlit_app.py, document_loader.py, rag_pipeline.py) are already properly commented and adhere to Python coding standards (e.g., PEP 8). They include:

Docstrings: Each function (load_documents, get_local_llm, etc.) has clear documentation with purpose, arguments, and return values.
Clean Structure: The code uses meaningful variable names, consistent formatting, and modular design (separating document loading and LLM pipeline logic).
No Changes Needed: The code is ready for submission as .py files. I'll organize them in a repository structure below.
2. Sample Questions and Chatbot Responses
I'll create a .txt file containing a sample set of questions and responses based on a hypothetical uploaded document. For demonstration, I'll assume a sample document (sample_doc.txt) with content about space exploration, and simulate questions and answers using the mock RAG logic from your code. This file will be included as an artifact.

sample_qa.txt
plain
Show inline
Steps to Save the Sample QA File:

Copy the content above (within the <xaiArtifact> tag, excluding the tag itself) into a file named sample_qa.txt.
Save it in your project directory (e.g., rag_chatbot/sample_qa.txt).
This file will be included in the GitHub repository.
3. GitHub Repository Setup
Here’s how to create and push your code and files to a GitHub repository:

Step 1: Initialize a Local Repository
Create a Project Directory:
bash

mkdir rag_chatbot
cd rag_chatbot
Copy Files:
Save the provided streamlit_app.py, document_loader.py, and rag_pipeline.py in the rag_chatbot directory.

Save sample_qa.txt (from the artifact above) in the same directory.

Create a requirements.txt to list dependencies:

text

streamlit==1.38.0
langchain==0.3.0
langchain-community==0.3.0
faiss-cpu==1.8.0
sentence-transformers==3.2.0
pypdf==5.0.1
docx2txt==0.8
transformers==4.44.2
torch==2.4.1
Create a README.md for documentation:

markdown

# RAG Chatbot with Document Upload

A Streamlit-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that allows users to upload documents (CSV, TXT, PDF, DOCX, JSON) and ask questions based on the content.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the app:
bash

streamlit run streamlit_app.py
Files
streamlit_app.py: Main application with UI and RAG logic.
document_loader.py: Document loading logic for various file types.
rag_pipeline.py: Local LLM setup using HuggingFace.
sample_qa.txt: Sample questions and responses.
requirements.txt: Dependencies for the project.
Features
Upload documents and query their content.
Debug mode to view retrieved documents.
Chat history with expandable entries.
Vibrant UI with bubble-style input and colorful messages.
Initialize Git:
bash

git init
git add streamlit_app.py document_loader.py rag_pipeline.py sample_qa.txt requirements.txt README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit: RAG chatbot with Streamlit UI and sample QA"
Step 2: Create and Push to GitHub
Create a GitHub Repository:
Go to GitHub and sign in.
Click "New" to create a repository named rag_chatbot.
Do not initialize with a README (since we created one locally).
Copy the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/your-username/rag_chatbot.git).
Link Local Repo to GitHub:
bash

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/rag_chatbot.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Verify:
Visit your GitHub repository URL to ensure all files (streamlit_app.py, document_loader.py, rag_pipeline.py, sample_qa.txt, requirements.txt, README.md) are uploaded.

4. Optional Streamlit Deployment (Bonus Points)
To earn bonus points, deploy the Streamlit app using Streamlit Community Cloud (formerly Streamlit Sharing).

Step 1: Prepare for Deployment
Ensure Dependencies: The requirements.txt file lists all necessary packages.
Test Locally:
bash

streamlit run streamlit_app.py
Verify the app runs, document uploads work, and questions are answered (using the mock LLM or your actual get_local_llm implementation).
Note: The mock load_documents only handles .txt files. For .pdf, .docx, etc., ensure your document_loader.py is fully implemented.
Step 2: Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud
Sign Up:
Go to Streamlit Community Cloud.
Sign in with your GitHub account.
Deploy the App:
Click "New App" > "Deploy from GitHub Repo".
Select your rag_chatbot repository.
Set the main file to streamlit_app.py.
Click "Deploy".
Streamlit will install dependencies from requirements.txt and run the app.
Note: If your get_local_llm uses a large model (e.g., flan-t5-small), ensure the Community Cloud’s resource limits (1GB RAM, limited CPU) can handle it. You may need to optimize or use a smaller model.
Get the App Link:
Once deployed, Streamlit provides a URL (e.g., https://your-app-name.streamlit.app).
Include this link in your submission email for bonus points.
Step 3: Test the Deployed App
Visit the app URL.
Upload a .txt file (or other formats if load_documents supports them).
Ask questions and verify the UI (bubble input, colorful messages, sidebar, history).
Check debug mode and history functionality.
Deliverables Summary
Python Code:
Files: streamlit_app.py, document_loader.py, rag_pipeline.py (already provided and documented).
Location: Pushed to GitHub repository.
Sample Questions and Responses:
File: sample_qa.txt (provided in artifact above).
Location: Pushed to GitHub repository.
GitHub Repository:
URL: https://github.com/your-username/rag_chatbot (replace with your username).
Contains: All code files, sample_qa.txt, requirements.txt, README.md.
Optional Streamlit Link:
Deploy the app and include the URL (e.g., https://your-app-name.streamlit.app) in your submission email.
Additional Notes
Mock LLM Limitation: The provided get_local_llm uses a FakeListLLM for demonstration. Replace it with a real LLM (e.g., google/flan-t5-small from rag_pipeline.py) for actual functionality. Ensure your system has sufficient resources (GPU recommended for HuggingFace models).
Document Loader: The provided document_loader.py supports multiple file types. Test with actual files (e.g., .pdf, .docx) to ensure compatibility.
Error Handling: If deployment fails due to resource limits or missing modules, consider using a lighter LLM or hosting on a local server (e.g., via ngrok for public access).
Submission: In your email, include:
GitHub repository URL.
Path to sample_qa.txt in the repository.
Streamlit app URL (if deployed).
Next Steps
Follow the GitHub setup instructions to push the files.
Deploy the Streamlit app and test thoroughly.
If you need a real get_local_llm implementation or help with specific file types in load_documents, let me know!
Share your GitHub username or repository details if you need help verifying the setup.
Would you like assistance with a specific part (e.g., optimizing rag_pipeline.py, testing deployment, or creating additional sample QA files)?

draft me a proper readme file for this project


Below is a comprehensive README.md file for your RAG Chatbot project, tailored to meet the assignment requirements. It includes a clear project description, setup instructions, file structure, usage details, and deployment steps for Streamlit Community Cloud. The README is written in Markdown, adheres to best practices for clarity and professionalism, and reflects the vibrant UI and functionality of your Streamlit app. I'll wrap the content in an <xaiArtifact> tag as per the guidelines, using a new artifact_id since this is a distinct file from the previous ones.

Copy the content within the <xaiArtifact> tag (excluding the tag itself) into a file named README.md.
Place it in your rag_chatbot directory.
Update the Repository:
If you haven’t initialized the repository yet, follow the steps from the previous response:
bash

mkdir rag_chatbot
cd rag_chatbot
git init
Add the README.md along with other files (streamlit_app.py, document_loader.py, rag_pipeline.py, sample_qa.txt, requirements.txt):
bash

git add README.md streamlit_app.py document_loader.py rag_pipeline.py sample_qa.txt requirements.txt
git commit -m "Add RAG chatbot files with README and sample QA"
Push to GitHub:
bash

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/rag_chatbot.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Verify:
Visit your repository (e.g., https://github.com/your-username/rag_chatbot) to ensure the README.md renders correctly on the main page.
Update placeholders in the README (e.g., your-username, your-email@example.com) with your actual details.
Notes on README

I Dont have OPENAI API as it is a paid version hence i have used huggingface llm in this chatbot,openai would have reduced the code structure even more better way

need to add this inside,give me the correct grammatical version


To incorporate your statement about using a HuggingFace LLM instead of the OpenAI API due to cost considerations, I'll revise the README.md from the previous response to include a grammatically correct and polished version of this information. The statement will be added in the Limitations section to explain the choice of LLM and its implications, ensuring clarity and professionalism. The rest of the README remains unchanged to maintain its comprehensive structure, and I'll wrap the updated content in an <xaiArtifact> tag with the same artifact_id as the previous README, incrementing the artifact_version_id.

Revised Statement
Original:

I Dont have OPENAI API as it is a paid version hence i have used huggingface llm in this chatbot,openai would have reduced the code structure even more better way

Revised (grammatically correct and professional):

The OpenAI API, being a paid service, was not used in this project. Instead, a HuggingFace LLM (google/flan-t5-small) was implemented to keep the solution cost-free. While the OpenAI API could have simplified the code structure and potentially improved performance, the HuggingFace LLM provides a robust, open-source alternative for the RAG pipeline.

Mock LLM: The provided rag_pipeline.py uses a placeholder LLM (FakeListLLM). Replace with a real model (e.g., google/flan-t5-small) for production.
